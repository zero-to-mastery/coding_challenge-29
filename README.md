# coding_challenge-29 - Escape From Jurassic

Ohhhyaaaa!!!This is going to be another good one! **In this month's coding challenge we are going to build our own custom game using either Python or JavaScript**. We are going to customize the famous [Google Chrome Trex Game](https://elgoog.im/t-rex/). 

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work **or if you would like to look for people to work with on a project.** At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites/projects/code on here to showcase what the ZTM community has built.

## What Am I  Building??
**You will try to build and customize the Trex game with some help from some Github starter repos**. You can use whichever programming language: Python or JavaScript. 

To get you started, I have two repositories for you to clone and starting working on so that you don't have to code everything from scratch. Remember that your task is to customize it and make it "your own"!

[**For JavaScript Starter**](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner)

[**For Python Starter**](https://github.com/shivamshekhar/Chrome-T-Rex-Rush)

Let's see what you can come up with! Some ideas:
- Change the environment
- Change the character
- Change the colors

## Submissions:
At the end of the challenge, we will post everyone's projects down below so you can see what others have done. In order to see your submission below, make sure you read the next section for the submission guidelines (In *The Rules Are* section)!


## The Rules Are:

1. **You have until July 31st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## Looking for more challenges?
We highly recommend checking out the back catalogue of [coding challenges](https://zerotomastery.io/community/coding-challenges/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=coding_challenge-25). With varying levels of complexity there is something to test and push every skill level. 

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
